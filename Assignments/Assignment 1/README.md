## **Playing a Decent Game of Table Tennis**  
**<span style="color:red;">ðŸ”´ Not Feasible</span>**  

Historical context elucidates that the world began to see tennis-playing robots in the late 90s. An early model, **Ttmatc-101**, graced German catalogues in 1976. Since their debut more than half a century ago, these robots can put up a rigorous fight against most beginner-level players with little to no knowledge. However, even the most recent developments as late as just this previous year seem to decline significantly as the opponentsâ€™ experience increases.  

A decent game between average players of an amateur level can lead to the ping-pong ball reaching speeds over **100 mph**, rendering matching the skill level of anyone above the beginner level of the game an obstacle yet to be tackled.  

In terms of the technical limitations, the aforementioned fast-paced nature of the sport demands **swift perception paired with impeccable motor control**, governed by rapid decision-making. Consequently, replicating these human abilities in robots is complex due to **limitations in sensor technology, processing speed, and mechanical dexterity**.

## **Playing a Decent Game of Bridge at a Competitive Level**  
**<span style="color:red;">ðŸŸ¢ Feasible</span>**  

According to *The Guardian* in an article published in March 2022, an AI agent known as **NooK** defeated **eight world champions** at bridge. Since bridge is a skill-based game, the AI was trained on different plays and was able to learn over time, much like human learning patterns.

## **Writing an Intentionally Funny Story**  
**<span style="color:red;">ðŸ”´ Not Feasible</span>**  

There have been attempts to create AI agents and models that can generate comedic elements, such as **Jon the Robot**. However, this particular branch, full of potential, is still in its infancy, primarily due to the **nature of comedy itself**.  

Comedy is heavily subjective; it is a product of **culture and various nuances** that are so hard to perfect that even accomplished comedians can face backlash. Conclusively, perhaps AI can always respond with a well-structured punchline if one demands it, but it's safe to say that **behind every punchline is an actual person** who has deemed it funny for the program running the AI itself.

## **Giving Competent Legal Advice in a Specialized Area**  
**<span style="color:red;">ðŸ”´ Not Feasible</span>**  

AI has yet to shine in fields that require **out-of-the-box thinking**. Legal advice in specialized cases is heavily incumbent on professional individuals who **not only know the law of their jurisdiction but are also well-versed in loopholes and reading between the lines** to benefit clients. This is something AI has little mastery over.

## **Discovering Mathematical Theorems**  
**<span style="color:red;">ðŸ”´ Not Feasible</span>**  

Ironically, even though AI is built upon mathematics, **math stems from abstract thinking** and analyzing the nature of phenomena to come to logical conclusionsâ€”something so far only the **human mind is capable of**.

## **Performing a Surgical Operation**  
**<span style="color:red;">ðŸŸ  Feasible and Not Feasible</span>**  

Human life is precious, and leaving it **completely** in the hands of a machine will always pose risks, regardless of the machine's efficacy rate. AI is already assisting surgeons in the **operating room**, but human supervision is something that will perhaps never be eradicated from the health sector.  

Quick **decision-making skills and adaptability** in unexpected situations remain **unique to the human brain**, making full automation infeasible for now.

## **Unloading Any Dishwasher in Any Home**  
**<span style="color:red;">ðŸ”´ Not Feasible</span>**  

AI-powered dishwashers for home use exist, but they do **not manually unload dishes**. This is due to:  

- The **sheer cost and risk** of installing hardware that does not yet exist at a **commercially viable level**.  
- Variability in **kitchen layouts and dish arrangements**, making it difficult to develop a generalize
