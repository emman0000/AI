#Q2.

1) **Playing a decent game of table tennis.**üî¥ Not Feasible**  

Historical context elucidates that the world began to see tennis-playing robots in the late 90s. An early model ‚ÄúTtmatc-101‚Äù graced German catalogues in 1976. Since their debut more than half a century ago, these robots can put up a rigorous fight against most beginner-level players with little to no knowledge. However, even the most recent developments as late as just this previous year seem to decline significantly as the opponents‚Äô experience increases. A decent game between average players of an amateur level can lead to the ping pong ball reaching speeds over 100 mph, rendering matching the skill level of anyone above the beginner level of the game an obstacle yet to be tacked.
In terms of the technical limitations; the aforementioned fast-paced nature of the sport demands swift perception paired with impeccable motor control that is governed by rapid decision-making. Consequently, replicating these human abilities in robots is complex due to limitations in sensor technology, processing speed, and mechanical dexterity.

2) Playing a decent game of bridge at a competitive level (Feasible)
According to the Guardian in an article published in March 2022 an AI agent known as NooK beat 8 world champions at bridge. Since bridge is a skill-based sport the AI machine was trained over different plays and therefore was able to learn over a period of time much alike to human learning patterns.

3) Writing an intentionally funny story (Not Feasible)
   There have been attempts at creating AI agents and models that can generate comedic elements. An example of this could be Jon the Robot. However this  particular branch of full of potential is still in its infancy primarily due to the nature of comedy itself.
Comedy is heavily subjected; it is a product of culture and various nuances that is so hard to perfect that many a accomplished comedians well into the heights of their careers can also face backlash. Conclusively, perhaps AI can always respond with a well structured punchline if one demands it; but its safe to say that behind every punchline is an actual person that has deemed it funny to the program that runs the AI itself

4) Giving Competent legal advice in a specialised area (Not Feasible)
   AI has yet to shine in fields that require out of the box thinking. Legal advice in specialsed cases is heavily incumbent on professional individuals that not only know the law to whatever jursidiction they practice in but also must be well versed in loop holes and reading between lines to benefit clients. This is something AI has little mastery over.

5) Discovering Mathematical Theorems (Not Feasible)
   Ironically even though all of AI is built upon maths, Math stems from abstract thinking and and analysing the nature of phenomnons to come to logical conclusions something so far only the human mind is capable of

6) Perfoming a surgical operation (Feasible and Not feasible)
Human life is precious and to leave it completely in the hands of a machine will always garner risks that will exist regardless of the machines efficacy rate. In present times AI is already assisting surgeons in the OR but human supervision is something that will perhaps never be eradicated from the Health Sector since quick decision making skills and the ability to adapt when things go askew is something only the human brain has the capacity to accomodate as of now

7) Unloading any dishwasher in any home (Not Feasible)
   AI powered dishwashers for home use exist but they dont necessarily carry out the manual task of unloading dishes. This is ofcourse due to the sheer cost and risk of installing hardware that just doesnt exist at a commercial level to be manufactured for the mass market some industrial level dishwashers may exist but then again might not work as efficiently with all types of cutlery.

8) Construct a building (Not Feasible)
   Construction is one of those fields that will always rely on primitive concepts; building strong foundations , layering cement , bricks most constructions are all the same regardless of what period and purpose they fill. AI and robots in general can only go so far as to assist in  the planning phases of construction but the physcial component will at least for the forseeable future always demand manual labor buildings are too expensive and important to leave at the hands of a technology still in its infancy
